    <h1>How a page is created</h1>
    <p>
      All Wikipedia pages are created by accessing a page title that does not
      yet exist, usually by clicking on a red-colored link (which denotes
      non-existence, as opposed to a blue link which, with some exceptions,
      indicates the linked page exists). Creation is simple: upon clicking a red
      link, you will be transported to a blank page. Once there, enter any text
      and then click the Publish changes button. That's it; the page should have
      been created. Many pages are created after a user sees an existing red
      link on a page, and then follows these steps. The methods explored below
      describe how to access a non-existent page when a red link is not already
      presented to you, in order for you to follow these steps to creation.

    <h2>Method 1: searching</h2>
    <p>
      Enter text in the search field that you seek to create as a page title. If
      the title you entered does not already exist, is not technically
      restricted and is not creation protected, the resulting page will i) tell
      you that it does not exist; ii) advise that you can create the page, and
      iii) will provide a red link to the page title. It will normally appear in
      the following form (it may vary depending on the skin you have set):
    </p>
    <p>There were no results matching the query</p>
    <p><b>You may create the page</b>"Red-linked Text You Searched For".</p>
