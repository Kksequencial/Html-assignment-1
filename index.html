    <h1>How a page is created</h1>
    <p>
      All Wikipedia pages are created by accessing a page title that does not
      yet exist, usually by clicking on a red-colored link (which denotes
      non-existence, as opposed to a blue link which, with some exceptions,
      indicates the linked page exists). Creation is simple: upon clicking a red
      link, you will be transported to a blank page. Once there, enter any text
      and then click the Publish changes button. That's it; the page should have
      been created. Many pages are created after a user sees an existing red
      link on a page, and then follows these steps. The methods explored below
      describe how to access a non-existent page when a red link is not already
      presented to you, in order for you to follow these steps to creation.
