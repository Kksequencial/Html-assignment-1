    <h1>How a page is created</h1>
    <p>
      All Wikipedia pages are created by accessing a page title that does not
      yet exist, usually by clicking on a red-colored link (which denotes
      non-existence, as opposed to a blue link which, with some exceptions,
      indicates the linked page exists). Creation is simple: upon clicking a red
      link, you will be transported to a blank page. Once there, enter any text
      and then click the Publish changes button. That's it; the page should have
      been created. Many pages are created after a user sees an existing red
      link on a page, and then follows these steps. The methods explored below
      describe how to access a non-existent page when a red link is not already
      presented to you, in order for you to follow these steps to creation.
    </p>
    <h2>Method 1: searching</h2>
    <p>
      Enter text in the search field that you seek to create as a page title. If
      the title you entered does not already exist, is not technically
      restricted and is not creation protected, the resulting page will i) tell
      you that it does not exist; ii) advise that you can create the page, and
      iii) will provide a red link to the page title. It will normally appear in
      the following form (it may vary depending on the skin you have set):
    </p>
    <p>There were no results matching the query</p>
    <p><b>You may create the page</b>"Red-linked Text You Searched For".</p>
    <h2>Method 2: previewing a red link</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Click edit on any accessible page;</li>
      <li>
        Surround the page title you want to create in doubled brackets, e.g.,
        [[Proposed Title]];
      </li>
      <li>Click the Show preview button (not the Publish changes button);</li>
      <li>Click on the red link revealed.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Method 3: saving a red link</h2>
    <p>
      Often you will want to have easy continuing access to a page you create.
      One way is to save a link at your user page, or sometimes, on your user
      talk page. Once you save a red link there, and create the page, the link
      will turn blue and will be accessible anytime you visit it.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Go to your user or user talk page (both permanently linked at the top of
        any Wikipedia page);
      </li>
      <li>
        Surround the page title you want to create in doubled brackets, e.g.,
        [[Proposed Title]];
      </li>
      <li>Click the Publish changes button;</li>
      <li>Click on the red link revealed.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Method 4: changing a URL</h2>
    <p>
      If you click edit on any existing page or page section and then change the
      title of the page shown in the URL of your browser's address bar to the
      name of a non-existent page, and then hit return/enter, the resulting page
      shown will be the same as if you clicked on a red link, allowing you to
      create a page by the title entered. For example, were you to click edit at
      the top of this page, you would see this URL in your browser's address
      bar:
    </p>
    <p>
      https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:How_to_create_a_page&action=edit
    </p>
    <p>
      To make a page called "Proposed Title" using it, you would change it to:
    </p>
    <p>https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Proposed Title&action=edit</p>
